# My Home Assistant Config

## Maximalist Dashboard

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open source home automation server that integrates nearly 2000 existing IoT services into one powerful, private, and unified user interface.

This is a redacted version of the dashboard configuration for my personal instance of Home Assistant.

The design is based on the principle that *data is beautiful*. The dashboard is information dense - it is designed to maximize the amount of information displayed without additional user interactions. It uses Metro design system to reduce visual clutter, create a sense of visual hierarchy, and focus on the data.

This also acts as a demo and example of what the Metrology theme is capable of.
